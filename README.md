# Collaborative Programmable Music.

Overtone is an Open Source toolkit for designing synthesizers and
collaborating with music.  It provides:

* A Clojure API to the SuperCollider synthesis engine
* A growing library of musical functions (scales, chords, rhythms,
  arpeggiators, etc.)
* Metronome and timing system to support live-programming and sequencing
* Plug and play MIDI device I/O
* A full Open Sound Control (OSC) client and server implementation.
* Pre-cache - a system for locally caching external assets such as .wav
  files
* An API for querying and fetching sounds from http://freesound.org
* A global concurrent event stream

## Quick Start

### Installation

- Install Java, since this is a prerequisite for Clojure
  - Quite often Java will already be installed, if `java -version` works and
    shows you a version of 11 or higher you should be good
  - On Linux, you should be able to use your operating system package manager,
    for instance on Ubuntu the package will be called something like
    `openjdk-17-jdk`
  - On MacOS you can use Homebrew if you have it
  - [https://adoptium.net/](Adoptium.net) has installers for most operating systems
  
- Install the Clojure CLI tools, see [Install Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
  - Also install `rlwrap` if you can, without it `clojure` will work, but `clj`
    will not, and you won't have history and line editing in your Clojure REPL
  
- Install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), preferrably through your operating system's package manager (apt, yum, pacman, homebrew, chocolatey, etc.)
  - The main package is called `supercollider` everywhere
  - If there's a package names `sc3-plugins`, then install that as well

At this point you should have `clojure` and `scsynth` available.

```shell
$ clojure --version
Clojure CLI version 1.11.1.1413

$ scsynth -v
scsynth 3.13.0 (Built from  '' [na])
```

On macOS, `scsynth` might not be available but it's sufficient to have SuperCollider
installed at `/Applications/SuperCollider.app`.
This is homebrew's behavior.

Now you can add `overtone/overtone` as a dependency, and start a Clojure REPL.

```sh
mkdir happy-vibes && cd happy-vibes
echo '{:deps {overtone/overtone {:mvn/version "0.15.3295"}}}' > deps.edn
clj

Clojure 1.11.1
user=>
```

### Making sounds


```clj
;; boot the server
user=> (use 'overtone.live)
--> Loading Overtone...
[overtone.live] [INFO] Found SuperCollider server: /usr/bin/scsynth (PATH)
--> Booting external SuperCollider server...
--> Connecting to external SuperCollider server: 127.0.0.1:26325
[scynth] SuperCollider 3 server ready.
--> Connection established

;; listen to the joys of a simple sine wave
user=> (demo (sin-osc))

;; or something more interesting...
user=> (demo 7 (lpf (mix (saw [50 (line 100 1600 5) 101 100.5]))
                    (lin-lin (lf-tri (line 2 20 5)) -1 1 400 4000)))
```

### Linter (clj-kondo)

Run `overtone.linter/emit!` to emit clj-kondo configuration.

Do **not** commit the generated files, it's a bunch of data.

### Detailed Instructions

For a more detailed set of setup instructions (including details specific to
Windows and Linux) head over to the [Overtone wiki installation
page](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-Overtone)

We maintain documentation for all aspects of the system in the [project
wiki](https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Home), you'll find tutorials and
examples on topics such as synthesizing new sounds from scratch, live-coding and
generating musical scores on the fly. If you see anything missing, please feel
free to add it yourself, or hit us up on the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone) and we'll sort something out.

## Cheat Sheet

For a quick glance at all the exciting functionality Overtone puts at your
musical fingertips check out the cheat sheet:

## Overtone Powered Bands

A list of bands using Overtone to generate sounds:

## Community

### Mailing List

We encourage you to join the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone) to see what other people are
getting up to with Overtone. Use it to ask questions, show off what you've made
and even meet fellow Overtoners in your area so you can meet up for impromptu
jam sessions. All we ask is that you be considerate, courteous and respectful
and that you share as much of your code as possible so we can all learn how to
make crazy cool sounds together.

### Clojurians Slack

### Introductions

Head over to Vimeo for a fast-paced 4 minute introduction to live-coding
with Overtone to see what's possible

  http://vimeo.com/22798433

For a nice overview of the basics of creating and playing with
synthesized instruments in Overtone checkout Philip Potter's 20 minute
workshop:
